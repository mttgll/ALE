I'm not from Thanalan but that's probably easy to tell!" She laughed softly before clearing her throat. "Anyway! Hopefully, your search for greater understanding of different combat disciplines will be quite fruitful. There'll be a lot to learn but that's a good thing, of course. One must always be learning!"

(CEMOTE) Thuraya HoshinoBalmung:  glances back towards Eyja, briefly going glaze-eyed as she attempts to recall what was said, "Oh, yes. My sincere apologies. Yes, both of them." She says with a smile. "Their names are Thalli and Vonni. And their are Masterclases and Chaos bringing. Most cannot endure them for long periods. They have the most peculiar way of simply... overwhelming even the most stalwart of individuals."

(SAY) Qt Pie: I'm great! Thank you for asking love!

(CEMOTE) Inalchi Hotgo:  shakes his head "Oh well I wouldn't call it a game necessarily! When we go out drinking like this we try to get as many people as possible...just cause it would be fun to have more people really"

(CEMOTE) Eyja Kagon:  ❘ "Or maybe you just struggle with keeping track of people in general?" Eyja suggested with another sip of the newly found drink. "Could be... not that that's any kind of criticism, of course. Just seems..." He looked back to Aiyaku. "... like you are rather easily focused on a single individual." He watched the charades for another long moment, then tilted his head. "That's the reason I was asking if both of them were like that. She's ah... describing herself compared to her own twin, -

"It has been some time since I visited Eorzea," she says softly, "though I found my thoughts pulling me here after many moons of work in Kugane.

(CEMOTE) Thuraya HoshinoBalmung:  makes a soft 'ahhh' sounds, nodding at her. "I see." She smiles softly, though it rapidly turns wry. "I did say most-- but not myself. I am one of the fear they will listen to. I was already an adult when they were born, so I all but helped raise them. I'm rather immune to their chaos, for the most part."

(PARTY) Local Ramenguy: oh ok

(PARTY) Xaveze FelixDiabolos: so for the next delta attack
(PARTY) Alena Nephorius: the 2nd one
(PARTY) Xaveze FelixDiabolos: everyone needs to get directly behind boss while tanks do their own shit

(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "The laws of arcane geometry state she is a carbuncle." nodding
(SAY) Hyo Stormclaw: "But please don't let me hold you up if you have business to attend to."
(CEMOTE) Telany SilverwindDiabolos:  blinks.
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Nnnnnnnooooo, you look like a Viera to me."
(SAY) Rhiannon Astra: "I am most definitely a Carbuncle. Promise."

(SAY) Faena Lumina: "Alrighty! See you around good lookin'~"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "As her Summoner, I assure you she is telling the truth. Though the process is exceptionally-...she should not have survived but she did." answering aloud

(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Okay."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Think about it like one would a Kitsune or other-such."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "...The FUCKS a Kitsune?!"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Westerners have no equivalent. Look through enough Eastern erotica and figure it out; that is your specialty."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Oh fuck you too."
(CEMOTE) Telany SilverwindDiabolos:  would grumble in single.
(CEMOTE) Rhiannon Astra:  shrugged a bit at that.  "It's complicated; best not to overthink it."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "She is correct. Just understand she is a person capable of making her own decisions, and she should be treated as such."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Soo you're telling ME that she's one of those...glowy looking creepy foxes?"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Carbuncle? Yes."

(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Milany wants to eat them."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "They look yummy."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Do you know what a squirrel is, Milany?"
(SAY) Rhiannon Astra: "She can't. They'll give her indigestion."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "You cant fault me!"
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Yes, I know what squirrels are, eat them all the time."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "I have never eaten carbuncle, so I cannot say."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Tasty bastards."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "You remind me of one! I suppose you are what you eat, which has nothing to do with being a Viera or Miqo'te I will have you know."
(SAY) Rhiannon Astra: "Empty calories, not very filling. Would 100% give an upset stomach."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Staring at Hye'jin already gives me one."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "I'm used to it."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "A squirrel?"
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "...Just forget it."
(CEMOTE) Rhiannon Astra:  picks up the Carbuncle and cradles it in her arms, running a hand over the glowy baby's ears and kissing it's nose. "Batzorig is a good baby~"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "I will not, squirrel."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "I'm not a damnable squirrel!"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "You remind me so much of one, though... Bushy tail with long locks in a ponytail.. The behavior, the attitude, the eyes.."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Do I look like I have a stupid tail coming out of my ass?!"
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "DO I?!"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "No no, your hair style reminds me of one. Symbolically."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "Then I'm not a -FUCKING- squirrel!"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "I said you remind me of one. I did not say you were seventeen squirrels in a Viera outfit."
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "...I'll just roll with it..."
(CEMOTE) Rhiannon Astra:  nibbles her cookie and offers the other half to the Carbuncle in her arms, who takes it and munches away, getting crumbs everywhere.
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Well I would hope so. The alternative is to be a seventeen squirrels in a very realistic allagan mock-up of a Viera, partially filled with mechnical systems and aetherochemically augmented flesh meant to imitate real flesh to a surprising degree. The real question is: Where would you fit the other fifteen squirrels?"
(SAY) Rhiannon Astra: "That is surprisingly descriptive. Experience?"
(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "I'ma bout to fit fifteen squirrels up your ass if you don't cut that shit out!"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Minus the squirrels of course."
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "But you have eaten all of the squirrels."
(SAY) Rhiannon Astra: "That is a lot of squirrels..."
(SAY) Zhira Cahlio: "Mmm~."

(SAY) Telany SilverwindDiabolos: "I'm out of here!"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "I hope she finds her squirrels. Nira made curry, so perhaps if that fails she will still have a good meal."
(SAY) Rhiannon Astra: "Ooo, curry~ Is it spicy?"
(SAY) Hye-jin Cho: "Of course it is! Who makes curry without spice? It is like a bloodmoth without wings."

(CEMOTE) Coalesca MarenusBalmung:  glares deep into the white-irised eyes and then past them- a soldier's stare into the distance, sight through body as her nostrils flared. With but one quick thrust of the knife, she could dash every dream the dark-skinned Duskwight had in an instant... and bring down every Brass Blade and Flame present upon her head. Such a sad turn of events. It appeared that Freya would get the opportunity she so desired, after all. Raising the knife, she flicked her eyes to Serena before--

(SAY) Coalesca MarenusBalmung: --speaking. "A pact sealed with blood. Your body, your mind, you aether- all are meaningless, save to be an extension of our will. You forsake your autonomy in your quest to follow, to serve- and it will not be returned to you. You will toil under the twin blazing suns of myself and Serena, and you will not ask for shade, for water, for sustenance- that which we do not provide, you do not deserve. That which you do is still but a gift from your Mistresses- the concept of a reward no longer--
(SAY) Coalesca MarenusBalmung: --exists."

Stoppering the bounty, she hands both vials to Serena, who would perform- now or later- the enchantments required. "You give yourself freely, knowing that you may only be a husk at the--

(SAY) Coalesca MarenusBalmung: --conclusion- bereft of life then as you are value, now. Worthless save for your as-yet petty uses." She reaches out with a claw and grabs the cut arm- ensuring that two of the claws sink into the wound, slicing deeper and stinging. "Your life is forfeit. Every breath that leaves you lungs from this point forward is by the good graces of your new objects of worship. I would say that I hope the Gods have mercy on your soul, but they matter not- not anymore... and I will--

(PARTY) Isidora Domani: its not even blind
(PARTY) Rian Ryuuketsu: "semi-blind", which means nothing
(PARTY) Isidora Domani: 2) You're going in completely or mostly blind 3) Understand that clearing before EW would be the priority over blind progging, and therefore we'll probably have a system to vote on looking up mechanics after a certain period of time if we can't figure them out. We'll also be okay with studying Alexander Savage if it helps

(PARTY) Rian Ryuuketsu: holy shit
(PARTY) Isidora Domani: wah
(PARTY) Rian Ryuuketsu: being any kind of "blind" is going to make it appeal to only the most hardcore of people (who have already cleared and thus have no interest), or people who have zero idea what theyre getting in to, and whats expected of them
(PARTY) Isidora Domani: i dont think thats related to not being available at all
