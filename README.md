## Usage

1. Check or uncheck which channels to include or exclude.

2. Click on the `Select File and Extract` button.

    * ACT log files are usually found in `AppData\Roaming\Advanced Combat Tracker\FFXIVLogs`.

4. Wait for the log file to be parsed.
    * ACT log files can be very large, so this may take some time.

    * The default filename is `ExtractedLog.txt`. The user may enter a different filename or use a different file extension if they wish.
